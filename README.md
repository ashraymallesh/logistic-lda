# Exploring Logistic Regression and LDA Performance on Wine and Breast Cancer Datasets

### [Project Spec](miniproject1_spec.pdf)

Your first task is to acquire the data, analyze it, and clean it (if necessary). Now you will implement the logistic regression and LDA models. You are free to implement these models as you see fit, but you should follow the equations that are presented in the lecture slides, and you must implement the models from scratch (i.e., you cannot use SciKit Learn or any other pre-existing implementations of these methods). In particular, your two main tasks in the part are to:

1. Implement logistic regression using gradient descent, as discussed in Lecture 4. 
2. Implement linear discriminant analysis using the equations from Lecture 5.

You are free to implement these models in any way you want, but you must use Python and you must implement the models from scratch (i.e., you cannot use SciKit Learn or similar libraries). Lastly, you should implement a script to run k-fold cross validation.

### Tasks:

1. Test different learning rates for logistic regression.
2. Compare the runtime and accuracy of LDA and logistic regression on both datasets.
3. For the wine dataset, find a new subset of features and/or additional features that improve the accuracy. We recommend that you use logistic regression for this exploration. Hint: Try exploring different interaction terms.
